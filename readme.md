/u/upmo
====

This is an AutoMod bot which scans /r/unixporn for new posts while making sure that the rules are being followed. Most of the code originally comes from several separate bots written by /u/GoldenSights for various subs. From there they were reworked, merged and heavily modified to fit the subreddit needs. The major changes are the dynamic timer, use of a single text file instead of 5 SQL databases for history management, the warning added into the details comment checker, a weekly thread poster, and multiple flairs assignment.
